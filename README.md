This is and updated version of the microphysical model that appears in 
Andreas, Edgar L. "Time constants for the evolution of sea spray droplets." Tellus B 42.5 (1990): 481-497.

I used this model to compute results for my paper in JGR: Oceans
Sroka, Sydney, and Kerry Emanuel. "Sensitivity of Sea‚ÄêSurface Enthalpy and Momentum Fluxes to Sea Spray Microphysics." Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans 127.1 (2022): e2021JC017774.
